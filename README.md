# 📊 Analyzing the Impact of NPAs on Bank Growth & Efficiency: A Comparative Study of Public vs Private Sector Banks

This project explores how **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)** impact the profitability, efficiency, and financial health of Indian public and private sector banks. It is developed using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for analysis and **Power BI** for interactive visualization.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `PSU_Banks_Data.xlsx` - Financial dataset for 10 public sector banks
- `Private_Banks_Data.xlsx` - Financial dataset for 10 private sector banks
- `NPA_Impact_Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with all data analysis and visualizations
- `PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix` - Dashboard (optional) showing graphical insights
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how **Gross NPA %**, **Operating Efficiency Ratio (OER)**, and other financial indicators like **ROA**, **ROE**, **NIM**, etc., affect the **Net Profit Margin (NPM)** and growth of Indian banks.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- Comparative analysis between **Public and Private Sector Banks**
- Correlation and regression plots (using Seaborn & Matplotlib)
- Visualizations of:
  - Gross NPA % vs Net Profit Margin (NPM)
  - OER vs NPM
  - Category-wise bar charts for comparison
- Bank categorization using `Bank Type` feature
- Cleaned, structured dataset used for reproducible insights

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for data formatting)
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

---

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- **Linear Regression Plot:** Gross NPA % vs NPM  
- **OER Impact:** How OER affects profitability  
- **Bar Charts:** Category-wise comparison of financial indicators  
- **Bank Type Segmentation:** Separate views for PSU and Private Banks

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in Anaconda or VSCode
3. Make sure required libraries (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`) are installed
4. Run the notebook cells step by step
5. Optionally, open the Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling
